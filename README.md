Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.
The objective is to build a supervised machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species.

Dataset Information
150 samples

4 numerical features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

3 target classes:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

Models Implemented
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier

Model Performance
Both models achieved 100% accuracy on the test dataset.
